## Abstract:

This website is a compilation of tutorial videos to assist users with learning to code.  Videos are divided up into Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced Tiers.  Users will be able to log in and comment on videos.  On a user's home page they will be able to view all their comment history and delete those comments.

## Project Brief:

The project uses a combination of a React-based front end for page flow, styling and responsiveness.  ________ is utilized as the design API library.  Users will either be able to sign up or log in to their account, which allows them to leave feedback comments on the videos and manage those comments.  The home page will display one featured video for each skill level (beginner, intermediate, and advanced.)   Each page contains a navbar at the top to display the title of the current page and navigate to different locations of the website.  There is also a static footer at the bottom of each page containing The website information.  When a skill level is selected; the page changes to a series of videos (initially 3 seeded videos) appropriate to that skill level. After a specific video is selected, it will display and populate comments from all users below it. This website is also mobile-responsive.
